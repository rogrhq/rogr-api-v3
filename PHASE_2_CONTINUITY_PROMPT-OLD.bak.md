# ðŸš€ PHASE 2 CONTINUITY: MDEQ System + Stance Fix Validation

## CURRENT STATUS: MDEQ BREAKTHROUGH COMPLETE + CRITICAL FIX READY FOR TESTING

**âœ… MAJOR ACHIEVEMENTS:**
- **MDEQ Integration**: Multi-Dimensional Evidence Quality system operational end-to-end
- **Step 2D Complete**: 3/4 false claims achieving <30/F scores through quality assessment  
- **Stance Classification Fix**: Critical inconsistency bug fixed in both AI systems

**ðŸ”§ CRITICAL FIX APPLIED (Needs Validation):**
**Issue**: "The Earth is flat" scoring inconsistently (29/F vs 60/D+) due to scientific evidence being misclassified as "supporting" false claims
**Solution**: Fixed stance analysis prompts in both `claude_evidence_shepherd.py` and `ai_evidence_shepherd.py` with explicit claim context

## IMMEDIATE NEXT ACTIONS:

### 1. **Validate Stance Classification Fix**
```bash
# Pull latest code, restart backend, then test:
curl -X POST "https://BACKEND_URL/test-mdeq" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{"claim": "The Earth is flat"}'
```
**Expected**: Consistent <30/F scores (not random 29/F vs 60/D+)

### 2. **Remove Emergency Fallback Caps**
Once stance fix validated, remove emergency domain-based caps in `main.py` lines 310-336

### 3. **Continue to Step 15: ClaimReview Integration** 
Add ClaimReview API connector per ROGR_PRIMER_v2.md step index

## KEY TECHNICAL STATE:
- **Backend**: https://811efd66-721a-418d-978d-2fb9a8b674e6-00-18dh30ad08soc.janeway.replit.dev
- **MDEQ System**: Fully operational with quality-weighted consensus scoring
- **Files Ready**: `evidence_quality_assessor.py`, `multi_ai_evidence_shepherd.py`, updated `main.py`
- **Testing Endpoint**: `/test-mdeq` for isolated MDEQ testing (bypasses ClaimMiner)

## SUCCESS CRITERIA:
- All false claims score <30/F consistently through MDEQ quality assessment
- No more 60/D+ scores for obvious false claims like flat earth
- Scientific evidence properly classified as "contradicting" false claims

**PRIORITY**: Validate stance fix resolves inconsistency, then proceed with MVP development timeline.
