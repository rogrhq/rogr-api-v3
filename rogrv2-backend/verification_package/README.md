# VERIFICATION PACKAGE - ROGRV2 SOURCE OF TRUTH

**Purpose:** Complete package for independent verification of source of truth document
**Created:** 2025-09-30 (Session 4)
**Method:** Full independent verification by 2 separate Claude Code sessions

---

## CONTENTS

### 1. SOURCE_OF_TRUTH_ROGRV2_COMPLETE.md (THE DOCUMENT TO VERIFY)
**Size:** ~26KB
**What it contains:**
- Complete verified codebase state
- 18 files inspected (1,644 lines personally read)
- All P1-P13 packet status
- Integration gaps identified
- Architect clarifications integrated
- User requirements documented
- Completion plan (Phase 1A-D, 2-3 weeks)
- Line-number citations for every claim

**This is what needs to be verified for accuracy.**

---

### 2. CODEBASE_STATE_ASSESSMENT.md (Session 3 baseline)
**Size:** ~18KB
**Source:** Session 3 codebase inspection
**What it contains:**
- Direct code inspection of 15+ files (~750 lines)
- Comprehensive mapping of what exists vs what's missing
- Identified critical gap: integration, not missing features
- Found evidence of mid-refactor state

**Purpose:** Reference document showing what Session 3 found (Session 4 verified this was 98% accurate)

---

### 3. architect_answers_session3.md (Context - 43 Q&A)
**Size:** ~14KB
**Source:** Architect provided complete answers to 43 validation questions
**What it contains:**
- B1-B4: Blocking questions (16 Q&A)
- I5-I12: Important questions (18 Q&A)
- C13-C17: Clarification questions (9 Q&A)

**Purpose:** Context for architect's design decisions, scope, and technical approach

**Key sections:**
- B1: Async migration plan
- B3: S3 numeric/temporal modules
- B4: S6 regression harness
- I11: AI model selection and token budgets
- I12: Provider configuration

---

### 4. ARCHITECT_Q1_Q6_ANSWERS.md (Critical clarifications)
**Size:** ~4KB
**Source:** User provided after Session 3 identified 6 critical questions
**What it contains:**
- Q1: Pipeline early return - intentional test shim with too-broad gate
- Q2: Duplicate normalize functions - refactor collision (unintentional)
- Q3: Multi-claim mode - architect says defer, user says Day 1
- Q4: interpret.py not called - intentionally bypassed for MVP
- Q5: Test mode behavior - clarification of what it should do
- Q6: Architect knows online.py exists - ADR wording misleading

**Purpose:** Explains WHY code is in current state, architect's intent

---

### 5. USER_REQUIREMENTS.md (Scope definition)
**Size:** ~5KB
**Source:** User clarifications during Session 4
**What it contains:**
- MVP definition (fully working product, not prototype)
- Core features MUST HAVE Day 1:
  - Multi-claim extraction from text
  - Live evidence gathering
  - **AI assist (4 components) - NOT OPTIONAL**
  - Primary/secondary/tertiary tagging
  - Zero bias + IFCN compliance
- Phase 2 features (after core works):
  - URL/audio/video extraction
  - Social feed
  - Archive
  - User tiers
- Critical requirements:
  - Zero bias IMPERATIVE
  - Test toggles must not block live mode
  - Breaking in dev is acceptable/good

**Purpose:** Clarifies user's actual requirements vs architect's narrower scope

---

### 6. SESSION_3_HANDOFF.md (Historical context)
**Size:** ~12KB
**Source:** Session 3 handoff document
**What it contains:**
- What was accomplished in Session 3
- Key discoveries from codebase inspection
- Files directly inspected (with line counts)
- Comparison: ADR plan vs actual reality
- Critical questions for architect (Q1-Q6)
- Bottom line assessment
- Next session tasks

**Purpose:** Historical context, shows progression of understanding

---

## VERIFICATION INSTRUCTIONS

### For Each Verifier (Session 5 and Session 6)

**Your task:** Independently verify the accuracy of `SOURCE_OF_TRUTH_ROGRV2_COMPLETE.md`

**Method:**
1. Read `SOURCE_OF_TRUTH_ROGRV2_COMPLETE.md` completely
2. Read all context documents (items 2-6 above)
3. Read the actual codebase files mentioned
4. Form your own independent assessment

**What to verify:**

**A. Code Claims (verify by reading actual files):**
- Are the 18 files accurately described?
- Are line number citations correct?
- Are function signatures accurate?
- Are the "what exists" claims true?
- Are the "what's missing" claims true?
- Is zero bias claim accurate (no domain whitelists)?

**B. Context Claims (verify against source documents):**
- Did architect really say X in Q1-Q6?
- Did architect really say Y in 43 Q&A?
- Did user really require Z?
- Are architect/user conflicts accurately portrayed?

**C. Completeness:**
- Were any files missed?
- Were any critical issues missed?
- Are effort estimates reasonable?
- Is completion plan feasible?

**D. Accuracy Metrics:**
- How many claims verified correct?
- How many claims found incorrect?
- What's your overall confidence level?

## VERIFICATION OUTPUT FORMAT

**Produce a report:** `VERIFICATION_REPORT_[A or B].md`

### Structure:

```markdown
# VERIFICATION REPORT - [Your Session Name]

**Date:** [Date]
**Verifier:** Session [5 or 6]
**Files Read:** [Count]
**Lines Inspected:** [Count]

---

## SUMMARY

**Claims Verified:** X/Y
**Claims Incorrect:** N
**New Findings:** M
**Overall Confidence:** [0-100%]

---

## VERIFIED CORRECT

### Code Claims
- [Claim from source of truth] - VERIFIED (file:line evidence)
- [Claim from source of truth] - VERIFIED (file:line evidence)
...

- [Claim about architect] - VERIFIED (document reference)
- [Claim about user] - VERIFIED (document reference)
...

## CONSENSUS PROCESS (After Both Sessions Complete)

**Step 1:** Compare 3 independent assessments
- Session 4 (original - this source of truth)
- Session 5 (Verifier A)
- Session 6 (Verifier B)

**Step 2:** Identify consensus
- 3/3 agree → HIGH CONFIDENCE, claim is accurate
- 2/3 agree → MEDIUM confidence, note dissent
- 1/3 or 0/3 agree → RE-INSPECT immediately, likely error

**Step 3:** Update source of truth if errors found
- Fix inaccurate claims with evidence
- Add missed items
- Update confidence levels
- Version bump (v1.0 → v1.1)

**Step 4:** Final verified document
- Consensus achieved
- All discrepancies resolved
- Ready for implementation

## IMPORTANT PRINCIPLES

### No Bias
Do NOT let the source of truth document bias you. Read the code independently and form your own conclusions. If you find something different than what's documented, report it.

### Complete Coverage
Verify ALL claims, not samples. This is comprehensive verification.

### Evidence Required
Every verification claim (correct or incorrect) must have evidence:
- Code claims → file:line citation
- Context claims → document reference

### Independent
Session 5 and Session 6 should NOT see each other's reports until both are complete. This ensures independent verification.
