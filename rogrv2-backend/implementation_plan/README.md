## How to Use This Framework

### Design Phase: Session Zero (3 Sessions)

**Session Zero is split into 3 design sessions to stay within token budgets:**

#### Session Zero-A: Phase 0 + 1A Design

1. **Start fresh Claude Code session**
2. **Copy-paste** `SESSION_ZERO_A_PROMPT.md` in its entirety
3. **Let Claude investigate** code and report findings
4. **Confirm investigation** before Claude proceeds
5. **Claude designs** Phase 0 and 1A specifications (~80-100K tokens)
6. **Claude produces:**
   - DESIGN_SPECIFICATIONS_PHASE_0_1A.md (complete)
   - step01_phase0.md and step02_phase1a.md (prompts)
   - MASTER_PLAN_PARTIAL.md

---

#### Session Zero-B: Phase 1B Design (AI Assist Layer)

1. **Start fresh Claude Code session** (after Zero-A completes)
2. **Copy-paste** `SESSION_ZERO_B_PROMPT.md` in its entirety
3. **Let Claude investigate** AI infrastructure and report
4. **Confirm investigation** before Claude proceeds
5. **Claude designs** all 4 AI components + integration (~100-120K tokens)
6. **Claude produces:**
   - DESIGN_SPECIFICATIONS_PHASE_1B.md (complete)
   - step03-step07 prompts (5 prompts)
   - MASTER_PLAN_UPDATE.md

---

#### Session Zero-C: Phase 1C + 1D Design

1. **Start fresh Claude Code session** (after Zero-B completes)
2. **Copy-paste** `SESSION_ZERO_C_PROMPT.md` in its entirety
3. **Let Claude investigate** multi-claim and S3 code and report
4. **Confirm investigation** before Claude proceeds
5. **Claude designs** Phase 1C and 1D specifications (~80-100K tokens)
6. **Claude produces:**
   - DESIGN_SPECIFICATIONS_PHASE_1C_1D.md (complete)
   - step08-step12 prompts (5 prompts)
   - MASTER_PLAN_COMPLETE.md (final merged plan)

**After all 3 design sessions: Complete implementation blueprint ready**

---

### Implementation Sessions (After All 3 Design Sessions)

#### Every Session Follows This Pattern:

**1. SESSION START**
- Copy-paste `SESSION_START_TEMPLATE.md`
- Claude reads context and reports understanding
- You confirm understanding ‚úì

**2. TASK ASSIGNMENT**
- Copy-paste step-specific prompt (e.g., `step_prompts/step01_phase0_s6.md`)
- OR copy-paste `NEXT_SESSION_PROMPT.md` if continuing work
- Claude implements per design specifications

**3. SESSION WRAPUP**
- Copy-paste `SESSION_WRAPUP_TEMPLATE.md`
- Claude executes quality gates:
  - Runs tests
  - Commits code
  - Updates PROGRESS_THREAD.md
  - Updates IMPLEMENTATION_STATE.md
  - Generates NEXT_SESSION_PROMPT.md if needed

- [ ] Branch correct? (rogrv2-backend-wrapup)
- [ ] Estimated tokens for this step? (Check MASTER_PLAN.md)

### Starting Session
- [ ] Paste SESSION_START_TEMPLATE.md
- [ ] Claude reports understanding
- [ ] I confirmed understanding ‚úì
- [ ] Paste task prompt (step-specific or NEXT_SESSION_PROMPT.md)

### During Session
- [ ] Claude following TENANTS.md? (‚úÖ/‚ùå RDT at start of responses)
- [ ] Claude investigating before proposing? (üîç INVESTIGATION blocks)
- [ ] Claude asking permission before file changes?

## Recovery Procedures

### If Session Fails or Context Lost

1. **Read PROGRESS_THREAD.md** (last complete entry)
2. **Check git log** (last commit SHA)
3. **Run regression tests** (verify current state)
4. **Read IMPLEMENTATION_STATE.md** (current snapshot)
5. **Use NEXT_SESSION_PROMPT.md** (if it exists)
6. **Continue from last known good state**

### If Tests Fail

1. **Do NOT proceed to next step**
2. **Document failure in PROGRESS_THREAD.md**
3. **Mark step as BLOCKED in IMPLEMENTATION_STATE.md**
4. **Create detailed NEXT_SESSION_PROMPT.md** explaining issue
5. **Investigate and resolve before continuing**

### If Design Spec Is Ambiguous

1. **STOP immediately**
2. **Ask user for clarification**
3. **Do NOT guess or assume**
4. **Update design spec after clarification**
5. **Continue with corrected spec**

## Key Principles

### Quality Over Speed
- Complete solutions, no band-aids
- Comprehensive testing at each step
- Thorough documentation always

### Context Preservation
- PROGRESS_THREAD captures complete history
- IMPLEMENTATION_STATE always current
- NEXT_SESSION_PROMPT for seamless handoffs

### Zero Interpretation Drift
- Design specifications are authoritative
- Implementation sessions execute, don't reinterpret
- Ask for clarification rather than assume

### Atomic Progress
- Each step is complete, testable unit
- Git commits are clean checkpoints
- Can rollback to any previous step

- Implementation Phase: 12 sessions (3-4 weeks)
  - 12 steps (Step 01 through Step 12)
- **Total: 15 sessions (3 design + 12 implementation)**

## Questions?

If anything is unclear:
- Read TENANTS.md (behavior guidelines)
- Read SESSION_ZERO_A_PROMPT.md (immediate next steps)
- Check PROGRESS_THREAD.md (session history)
- Review IMPLEMENTATION_STATE.md (current state)
