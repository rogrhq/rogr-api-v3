# SESSION WRAPUP - ROGRv2 Backend Completion

**Purpose:** Execute quality gates and prepare for next session

**Instructions for User:** Copy-paste this document when approaching end of session or when work is complete.

---

## Your Task

Execute the session wrapup protocol. This ensures all work is properly tested, committed, and documented before session ends.

**Execute these steps in order:**

---

## Step 1: Run Tests

### A. Run Regression Tests (if Phase 0 complete)
```bash
# Run the regression test suite
pytest intelligence/test/s6_harness.py -v
```

**Report:**
- Total tests: [count]
- Passed: [count]
- Failed: [count]
- Status: ‚úÖ ALL PASS / ‚ùå FAILURES DETECTED

**If failures:** Investigate immediately. Do not proceed until resolved or documented as known issue.

---

### B. Run New Tests (for current step)
```bash
# Run tests for current step implementation
[command based on current step]
```

**Report:**
- Total tests: [count]
- Passed: [count]
- Failed: [count]
- Status: ‚úÖ ALL PASS / ‚ùå FAILURES DETECTED

---

## Step 2: Git Commit

### A. Check Status
```bash
git status
```

**Report:**
- Modified files: [count]
- New files: [count]
- Ready to commit: [YES/NO]

---

### B. Create Commit (if changes exist)

**Commit message format:**
```
[Session XX] StepYY: [Brief description]

- [Change 1]
- [Change 2]
- [Change 3]

Tests: [status]
Next: [what's next]
```

**Ask permission:**
"May I commit these changes with the above message?"

**After user approval:**
```bash
git add [files]
git commit -m "[message]"
```

**Report commit SHA.**

---

## Step 3: Update Documentation

### A. Update PROGRESS_THREAD.md (APPEND ONLY)

Add new entry using this template:

```markdown
---

## Session XX - [DATE] - [STEP NAME]
**Status**: ‚úÖ COMPLETE | üîÑ IN PROGRESS | ‚õî BLOCKED
**Branch**: rogrv2-backend-wrapup
**Commits**: [SHA list]
**Tokens Used**: XXK / 150K target

```

**Ask permission:**
"May I append this entry to PROGRESS_THREAD.md?"

---

### B. Update IMPLEMENTATION_STATE.md (OVERWRITE)

Replace entire contents with current state snapshot:

```markdown
# IMPLEMENTATION STATE SNAPSHOT
**Last Updated:** [DATE] - Session XX
**Branch:** rogrv2-backend-wrapup
**Last Commit:** [SHA]

---

## Current Status

- [list or "Step complete"]

### Blockers
- [None or list]

---

## Test Status

**Regression Tests (Phase 0):**
- Status: [‚úÖ BUILT & PASSING / üîÑ IN PROGRESS / ‚è∏Ô∏è NOT YET BUILT]

---

**END OF STATE SNAPSHOT**
```

**Ask permission:**
"May I overwrite IMPLEMENTATION_STATE.md with this current state?"

---

## Step 4: Generate Next Session Prompt (If Needed)

**Only if current step is INCOMPLETE:**

2. Run new tests (must pass)
3. Commit code
4. Update PROGRESS_THREAD.md
5. Update IMPLEMENTATION_STATE.md

---

**Estimated tokens for completion:** ~[XX]K
```

**Ask permission:**
"May I create/update NEXT_SESSION_PROMPT.md with these continuation instructions?"

---

## Step 5: Final Report

Provide completion summary:

```markdown
## üèÅ SESSION WRAPUP COMPLETE

### Quality Gates Status
- ‚úÖ/‚ùå Regression tests passed
- ‚úÖ/‚ùå New tests passed
- ‚úÖ/‚ùå Code committed (SHA: [sha])
- ‚úÖ/‚ùå PROGRESS_THREAD.md updated
- ‚úÖ/‚ùå IMPLEMENTATION_STATE.md updated
- ‚úÖ/‚ùå NEXT_SESSION_PROMPT.md created (if needed)

### Session Summary
**Tokens used:** XXK / 150K target
**Step status:** ‚úÖ COMPLETE | üîÑ IN PROGRESS | ‚õî BLOCKED
**Next action:** [Continue current step | Start new step | Blocked on X]

### For Next Session
**Prompt to use:** [file path]
**Prerequisites:** [any setup needed]
**Estimated tokens:** ~XXK

---

**Session ready for handoff.** ‚úÖ
```

---

## Emergency: If Quality Gates Fail

**If tests fail or other quality gates can't be met:**

1. **Document the issue** in PROGRESS_THREAD.md
2. **Mark step as BLOCKED** in IMPLEMENTATION_STATE.md
3. **Create detailed NEXT_SESSION_PROMPT.md** explaining:
   - What failed
   - Why it failed
   - What needs to be investigated
   - Suggested approach to resolve
4. **Report blocker** to user with recommendation

**Do NOT hide failures. Transparent reporting is critical.**
