# ROGRv2 COMPLETION CHECKLIST

**Project:** ROGRv2 Backend - Final 10% Completion
**Date Created:** [Insert Date]
**Methodology:** STRICT FILE-WRITE MODE with mechanical packet implementation

---

## PHASE 1: PREPARATION (30 minutes)

### Required Files
- [ ] Get codebase zip from Claude Code using the zip creation prompt
- [ ] Verify you have SOURCE_OF_TRUTH_ROGRV2_COMPLETE.md (65KB)
- [ ] Verify you have packet_example.md (Packet S7)
- [ ] Ensure you have API keys ready: Brave, Google CSE, Anthropic

---

## PHASE 2: SAGPT SESSION (2-4 hours)

### Initial Setup
- [ ] Open new SAGPT session
- [ ] Upload all 3 files: SOURCE_OF_TRUTH, codebase.zip, packet_example.md
- [ ] Paste the complete SAGPT prompt (refined version)

### Deliverable
- [ ] SAGPT creates MASTER_COMPLETION_PLAN.md
- [ ] Download/save MASTER_COMPLETION_PLAN.md

---

## PHASE 3: VERIFICATION (1.5 hours)

### Three-Claude Review
- [ ] Open 3 separate Claude sessions for verification

#### Session A: Completeness Check
- [ ] All gaps from SOURCE_OF_TRUTH addressed?
- [ ] All Phase 1A-1D requirements covered?
- [ ] Rating: ___/10 (must be ≥8)

#### Session B: Feasibility Check
- [ ] Packet sizes realistic (<150 lines)?
- [ ] Context calculations correct?
- [ ] Dependencies properly ordered?
- [ ] Rating: ___/10 (must be ≥8)

#### Session C: Risk Assessment
- [ ] Integration risks identified?
- [ ] Rollback strategy defined?
- [ ] Context overflow mitigations?
- [ ] Rating: ___/10 (must be ≥8)

### Decision Gate
- [ ] All 3 sessions rate ≥8/10
- [ ] If any fail: Return to SAGPT with specific feedback, get revised plan

---

## PHASE 4: PACKET GENERATION (30 min per packet)

### Process
- [ ] Return to SAGPT with approved plan
- [ ] Request: "Generate Packet [NUMBER] following the plan"
- [ ] SAGPT produces packet in STRICT FILE-WRITE MODE format
- [ ] Save packet as packet[NUMBER].md

---

## PHASE 5: IMPLEMENTATION (15 min per packet)

### Execution Steps
- [ ] Open Claude Code in your project
- [ ] Paste packet exactly as provided
- [ ] Let Claude Code execute mechanically
- [ ] Run: `bash RUN_THIS_AFTER_WRITES.sh`
- [ ] Verify test passes

---

## PHASE 6: VALIDATION GATES

### After EACH Packet
- [ ] Test passes successfully
- [ ] Git diff shows only expected changes
- [ ] No regression in existing functionality
- [ ] Commit with message: "Packet [NUMBER]: [description]"

### After Phase 1A Packets (Integration Fixes)
- [ ] Run full API test: `/analyses/preview` works end-to-end
- [ ] Live evidence actually flows (with API keys)
- [ ] Lines 50-68 in pipeline.py now reachable

### After AI Foundation Packets
- [ ] Anthropic client connects successfully
- [ ] Cache layer functional
- [ ] Feature flag PIPELINE_AI_ASSIST works

### After AI Component Packets
- [ ] Quality metrics show 10%+ improvement
- [ ] AI assist can be toggled on/off
- [ ] All 4 AI components functional

### After Multi-Claim Packets
- [ ] Multiple claims extracted correctly
- [ ] Concurrent processing works
- [ ] No deadlocks or race conditions

---

## READY FOR IMPLEMENTATION CHECKPOINT

### Prerequisites Complete
- [ ] MASTER_COMPLETION_PLAN approved by 3 Claudes
- [ ] First packet generated and saved
- [ ] Claude Code open in project directory
- [ ] Terminal ready for test execution
- [ ] Git at clean state for easy rollback
- [ ] API keys configured in environment

---

## EXECUTION RHYTHM

### Per-Packet Workflow
1. Get packet from SAGPT (30 min)
2. Implement in Claude Code (5 min)
3. Run test (5 min)
4. Verify and commit (5 min)
5. IF FAIL: Stop, fix, retest
6. IF PASS: Request next packet

### Expected Timeline
- **Phase 1A** (Packets 14-17): 4 packets × 45 min = 3 hours
- **Phase 1B** (Packets 18-23): 6 packets × 45 min = 4.5 hours
- **Phase 1C** (Packets 24-25): 2 packets × 45 min = 1.5 hours
- **Total Active Implementation**: ~9 hours
- **Total Calendar Time**: 3-4 days with testing/debugging

---

## STOP CONDITIONS

### Immediate Stop Required If:
- [ ] Any packet fails testing twice
- [ ] Context overflow errors occur
- [ ] Unexpected files get modified
- [ ] Integration tests start failing
- [ ] System integrity test shows regressions

### Recovery Process
1. Git reset to last working commit
2. Analyze failure with SAGPT
3. Revise single packet only
4. Retest thoroughly
5. Continue only after verification

---

## SUCCESS METRICS

### Phase 1A Complete When:
- [ ] Gate bug fixed - live evidence flows
- [ ] Async orchestrator working
- [ ] Normalize functions merged
- [ ] P1 interpret.py wired

### Phase 1B Complete When:

- [ ] Result merging correct

### Project Complete When:
- [ ] All packets implemented
- [ ] All tests passing
- [ ] Full `/analyses/preview` API functional
- [ ] System integrity verified
- [ ] SOURCE_OF_TRUTH gaps closed
