CONTINUING ROGR PARALLEL ARCHITECTURE DEVELOPMENT

Read essential context files:
1. AI-SESSION-CONTEXT/CURRENT_SESSION_STATE.md (current project status)
2. AI-SESSION-CONTEXT/NEXT_SESSION_OBJECTIVES.md (this session's priorities)
3. AI-SESSION-CONTEXT/SESSION_START_PROTOCOL.md (mandatory session procedures)
4. RDT_v2.md (development methodology standards - ALWAYS REQUIRED)
5. AI-SESSION-CONTEXT/FLAWLESS_IMPLEMENTATION_METHODOLOGY.md (validation framework)
6. AI-SESSION-CONTEXT/IMPLEMENTATION_PROGRESS.md (project history & lessons learned)

Follow these requirements:
- Execute SESSION_START_PROTOCOL.md procedures
- Maintain RDT v2.0 compliance (all 8 enhanced tenants)
- Use 3-Layer Validation Framework for any implementation
- Follow Zero-Assumption rule (stop and request clarification for unclear specs)

Begin with current session objectives while maintaining full methodology compliance.
