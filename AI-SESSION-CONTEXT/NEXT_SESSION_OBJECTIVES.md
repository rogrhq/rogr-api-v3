# Next AI Session Objectives: Phase 2 - ParallelEvidenceOrchestrator Implementation

## âœ… PHASE 1 COMPLETE: Legacy Preservation + Parallel Foundation
**Status:** Validated on backend (33.7s processing, 200 status)
**Commit:** 2e4f9c3 - All import paths fixed, feature flag working
**Backend:** https://69780239-96f5-4ce3-b826-d3453286c75d-00-2q5k9aqq28xtu.picard.replit.dev/

## ðŸŽ¯ SESSION PRIORITY: Phase 2 Implementation (90 min)

### Hour 1.5 Objectives (Core Parallel System)
1. **ThreadSafeEvidenceWorker Implementation (35 min)**
   - Stateless worker using ThreadSafeResourcePool
   - Evidence processing with isolated AI clients and HTTP sessions
   - Error handling with OperationContext pattern from CODE_PATTERNS.md
   - Worker thread safety validation

2. **ParallelConsensusEngine Implementation (40 min)**
   - Claim-level parallelization (process 4 claims simultaneously)
   - AI-level parallelization within each claim worker (Claude + OpenAI concurrent)
   - Quality-weighted consensus integration using existing EvidenceQualityAssessor
   - Performance logging and monitoring

3. **Integration Testing & Deployment (15 min)**
   - Backend deployment with USE_PARALLEL_EVIDENCE=true
   - Performance validation: target <30s total processing time
   - A/B comparison test between legacy and parallel systems

## Success Criteria for Next Session
- [ ] Legacy system preserved and functional
- [ ] Parallel system directory structure created
- [ ] Basic resource pool implemented with thread isolation
- [ ] Feature flag integration working
- [ ] Git commit with "Phase 1: Legacy preservation + parallel foundation"

## Context Files to Update at Session End
- Update this file with Phase 2 objectives
- Update CURRENT_SESSION_STATE.md with implementation progress
- Create IMPLEMENTATION_PROGRESS.md with detailed completion tracking
- Document any new patterns in CODE_PATTERNS.md

## Architecture Reference
**Target Performance**: <30s total processing (87% improvement from 396s current)
**Key Innovation**: Complete thread-safety through resource isolation + parallel execution
**EEG Integration**: Methodology-first queries at orchestrator level
**ACI Integration**: Semantic analysis enhancing search strategy generation

## IMPORTANT: Complete Implementation Scope
**Total Phases**: 5 phases (not 4) - Phase 5 Integration is CRITICAL
**Phase 1-4**: Parallel evidence architecture implementation
**Phase 5**: ClaimMiner + FastAPI endpoint integration (REQUIRED for frontend compatibility)
**Without Phase 5**: System will not integrate with existing ClaimMiner or frontend
