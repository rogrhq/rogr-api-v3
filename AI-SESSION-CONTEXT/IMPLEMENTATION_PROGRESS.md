## Phase 1: Foundation & Legacy Preservation (NEXT SESSION START)
### Legacy System Preservation (0% complete)
- [ ] **Create `legacy_evidence_system/` directory**
- [ ] **Migrate 13 shepherd files from root directory:**
  - [ ] rogr_evidence_shepherd.py
  - [ ] dual_ai_evidence_shepherd.py  
  - [ ] claude_evidence_shepherd.py
  - [ ] rogr_dual_evidence_shepherd.py
  - [ ] ai_evidence_shepherd.py
  - [ ] evidence_shepherd_v2.py
  - [ ] rogr_evidence_shepherd_original.py
  - [ ] multi_ai_evidence_shepherd.py
  - [ ] multi_ai_evidence_shepherd_v2.py
  - [ ] test_evidence_shepherd_v2.py
  - [ ] evidence_quality_assessor.py (if evidence-related)
  - [ ] evidence_shepherd.py
- [ ] **Update imports in main.py** to maintain legacy system functionality
- [ ] **Test legacy system** works after migration
- [ ] **Git commit**: "Phase 1: Preserve legacy evidence system"

### Parallel System Foundation (0% complete)
- [ ] **Create directory structure:**
  ```
  parallel_evidence_system/
  ├── __init__.py
  ├── orchestrator/
  │   └── __init__.py
  ├── workers/
  │   └── __init__.py  
  ├── resources/
  │   └── __init__.py
  └── tests/
      └── __init__.py
  ```
- [ ] **Implement `ThreadSafeResourcePool` base class:**
  - [ ] Thread-local storage pattern
  - [ ] Resource isolation for HTTP sessions
  - [ ] API key pool with rate limiting
  - [ ] Context manager resource cleanup
- [ ] **Create `WorkerResourceBundle` class** for resource packaging
- [ ] **Basic validation tests** for thread safety
- [ ] **Git commit**: "Phase 1: Parallel system foundation"

### Integration Framework (0% complete)  
- [ ] **Implement `EvidenceSystemFactory` in main.py:**
  ```python
  def create_evidence_system(use_parallel: bool = False):
      if use_parallel:
          from parallel_evidence_system.orchestrator import ParallelEvidenceOrchestrator
          return ParallelEvidenceOrchestrator()
      else:
          from legacy_evidence_system.rogr_dual_evidence_shepherd import ROGRDualEvidenceShepherd
          return ROGRDualEvidenceShepherd()
  ```
- [ ] **Add `USE_PARALLEL_EVIDENCE` environment variable** handling
- [ ] **Feature flag integration** with main evidence processing endpoint
- [ ] **Basic A/B testing framework** for performance comparison
- [ ] **Git commit**: "Phase 1: Feature flag integration complete"

**Phase 1 Success Criteria:**
- Legacy system preserved and functional
- Parallel system structure created with basic resource pool
- Feature flag switching operational
- Foundation ready for worker implementation

## Phase 2: Core Parallel Architecture (PENDING PHASE 1)
### ThreadSafeEvidenceWorker Implementation
- [ ] Worker interface with `execute_strategy()` method
- [ ] Resource isolation validation
- [ ] Thread safety testing
- [ ] Evidence gathering parallel execution

### ParallelEvidenceOrchestrator Implementation  
- [ ] EEG Phase 1 integration (methodology-first queries)
- [ ] ACI pipeline integration (semantic analysis)
- [ ] Centralized strategy generation
- [ ] Strategy distribution to workers

### ParallelConsensusEngine Implementation
- [ ] Claim-level parallelization (4 claims concurrent)
- [ ] AI-level parallelization (dual AI per claim)  
- [ ] Consensus analysis with parallel results
- [ ] Performance monitoring and validation

---

## Phase 3: Production Integration (PENDING PHASE 2)
### Performance Optimization
- [ ] <30s processing time validation
- [ ] Memory usage optimization
- [ ] Error handling and timeout management
- [ ] Load testing with concurrent requests

### A/B Testing & Migration
- [ ] Legacy vs parallel performance comparison
- [ ] Quality assurance (consensus accuracy maintained)
- [ ] Gradual rollout strategy (5% → 25% → 50% → 100%)
- [ ] Production monitoring and alerts

## Current Session Context
**What We Discovered**: Sequential architecture fundamentally incompatible with <30s requirement
**What We Designed**: Complete parallel architecture preserving EEG + ACI benefits  
**What We Planned**: Legacy preservation + parallel implementation approach
**Next Critical Step**: Phase 1 foundation implementation in next AI session

## Blocking Issues: NONE
All analysis complete, architecture approved, ready for implementation start.

## Success Metrics
- **Performance**: <30s total processing time (vs 396s current)
- **Quality**: Consensus accuracy maintained or improved
- **Reliability**: Zero production incidents during migration  
- **Maintainability**: Clean modular architecture for future team development
