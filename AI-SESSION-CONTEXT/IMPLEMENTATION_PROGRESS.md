- [x] Resource isolation validation using ThreadSafeResourcePool
- [x] Thread safety testing with ThreadSafeComponent pattern
- [x] Evidence gathering parallel execution framework

- [x] ACI pipeline integration (semantic analysis) via methodology strategist
- [x] Centralized strategy generation with ParallelSearchStrategy (280 lines implemented)

---

## Phase 3: Production Integration - Investigation Complete, Missing Integration Path
### Configuration and Error Resolution ✅ COMPLETE
- [x] Fixed USE_EVIDENCE_SHEPHERD override preventing parallel system activation
- [x] Resolved ValueError in score_individual_claim function (dynamic unpacking)
- [x] Validated system responds with HTTP 200 and complete TrustCapsules
- [x] Confirmed parallel system created correctly at startup

### Root Cause Investigation ✅ COMPLETE
- [x] **CRITICAL DISCOVERY**: Missing dedicated USE_PARALLEL_EVIDENCE=true processing path
- [x] System falls back to legacy scoring instead of direct parallel integration
- [x] evidence_system.search_real_evidence() works but called indirectly through legacy path
- [x] Need third conditional path to call evidence_system.process_claims_parallel() directly

### Integration Implementation ✅ COMPLETE
- [x] Added dedicated parallel system path in main.py lines 805-816
- [x] Replaced legacy scoring fallback with direct evidence_system.process_claims_parallel()
- [x] Converted parallel consensus results to ClaimAnalysis format for TrustCapsule compatibility
- [x] Validated true parallel system execution without legacy system involvement

### BREAKTHROUGH: Content Extraction Fixed - Quality Assessment Bug Found ✅
- [✅] **Content extraction fixed** - parallel worker now uses correct field mapping
- [✅] **Best-effort processing implemented** - continues on 403 errors like legacy
- [✅] **Error handling enhanced** - detailed logging and graceful degradation
- [❌] **Quality assessment broken** - `.get()` calls fail on EvidenceQualityMetrics object
- [🔧] **Fix needed**: Replace dictionary interface with dataclass attribute access

### Performance Status ✅ ACHIEVED
- [x] System functional and responsive (HTTP 200 responses)
- [x] Processing completes without crashes or timeouts
- [x] Performance targets maintainable once direct integration implemented

## CRITICAL FINDINGS: Session 2025-09-15 Architectural Audit

### **ARCHITECTURAL COMPLIANCE AUDIT RESULTS**
**Overall Compliance**: 60% (FAILED - Insufficient for production)
**Implementation Scale**: 1,812 lines across 12 files
**Technical Debt**: HIGH - Multiple violations requiring assumptions to fix

### **🚨 CRITICAL ARCHITECTURAL VIOLATIONS**
1. **ADR-002 VIOLATION**: EvidenceScorer component specified but EvidenceQualityAssessor implemented
2. **INTERFACE VIOLATION**: WorkerResourceBundle missing ai_scorer field per specification
3. **FACTORY VIOLATION**: EvidenceSystemFactory class not implemented (only partial main.py integration)

### **📋 MAJOR ARCHITECTURAL GAPS**
1. **ACI Pipeline Components**: SemanticClaimAnalyzer, LogicalStructureAnalyzer not found
2. **EEG Phase 2**: CounterEvidenceEngine missing per architecture specification
3. **Performance Layer**: PerformanceOptimizer not implemented

### **⚠️ IMPLEMENTATION DEVIATIONS**
- Resource pool interface returns Dict vs WorkerResourceBundle
- Thread safety pattern inconsistencies across components
- Missing integration/ directory structure per Phase 5 specs

### **RDT COMPLIANCE ASSESSMENT**
**❌ FIXES WOULD VIOLATE RDT #4**: Creating missing components requires assumptions
**❌ ARCHITECTURE INCOMPLETE**: Critical components (EvidenceScorer) never specified in detail
**❌ TECHNICAL DEBT COMPOUNDING**: Each fix creates new assumptions and violations

## STRATEGIC DECISION: REVERT TO CLEAN STATE

### **COST-BENEFIT ANALYSIS**
**Fix Cost**: 40-60 hours with high RDT violation risk
**Revert Cost**: 4-6 hours with clean architectural restart
**Learning Preservation**: ✅ All context docs and methodology improvements retained
**Risk Assessment**: Revert significantly lower risk than fix attempts

### **POST-REVERT REQUIREMENTS**
1. **Complete Architectural Specification**: All components detailed before implementation
2. **Flawless Validation Methodology**: AI self-certification failed, new approach required
3. **RDT Compliance Framework**: Systematic validation at each implementation step
