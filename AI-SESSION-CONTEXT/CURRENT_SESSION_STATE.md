# Session State: 2025-01-14 - Phase 1 Complete: Legacy Preservation + Parallel Foundation

## What Was Accomplished This Session
- [x] **PHASE 1 COMPLETE**: Legacy system preserved + parallel foundation established
- [x] **LEGACY MIGRATION**: 11 shepherd files moved to legacy_evidence_system/ with import fixes
- [x] **THREAD-SAFE FOUNDATION**: ThreadSafeResourcePool + WorkerResourceBundle implemented
- [x] **FEATURE FLAG INTEGRATION**: USE_PARALLEL_EVIDENCE with graceful fallback complete
- [x] **PRODUCTION VALIDATED**: Backend testing confirms Phase 1 success (33.7s, 200 status)
- [x] **RDT COMPLIANCE**: Full investigation + validation before implementation

## Current Code State
**Branch:** main (Phase 1 complete, ready for Phase 2)
**Last Commit:** 2e4f9c3 - "HOTFIX: Fix all import paths for legacy system migration"
**Backend Status:** ✅ Operational - https://69780239-96f5-4ce3-b826-d3453286c75d-00-2q5k9aqq28xtu.picard.replit.dev/
**Performance Status:** 33.7s (legacy system preserved) vs <30s target (Phase 2 needed)

## Architecture Analysis Results
### Sequential Processing Bottlenecks Identified:
1. **Dual AI Sequential Execution**: Primary → Wait → Secondary → Wait = 2x processing time
2. **Shared Resource Conflicts**: Non-thread-safe sessions, API keys, consensus analysis
3. **Evidence Scoring Chain**: 30s timeout × 2 AIs × 4 claims = 240s+ sequential processing
4. **Web Search Timeout Stacking**: Multiple API timeouts compounding delays

### Parallel Architecture Solution Designed:
- **ParallelEvidenceOrchestrator**: Centralized strategy generation (EEG + ACI)
- **ThreadSafeEvidenceWorker**: Stateless parallel execution workers
- **ThreadSafeResourcePool**: Isolated HTTP sessions, AI clients, rate limiting
- **ParallelConsensusEngine**: Claim-level + AI-level parallelization

## Next AI Session Should Start With
1. **IMMEDIATE (5 min)**: Read this document + NEXT_SESSION_OBJECTIVES.md + SESSION_START_PROTOCOL.md
2. **PHASE 2 EXECUTION (90 min)**: Implement ParallelEvidenceOrchestrator:
   - ThreadSafeEvidenceWorker implementation (35 min)
   - ParallelConsensusEngine with claim-level parallelization (40 min)
   - Integration testing and backend deployment (15 min)
3. **RDT COMPLIANCE (10 min)**: Update context documentation with Phase 2 progress

## CRITICAL: Complete Context Transfer System Ready
- [x] AI-SESSION-CONTEXT/ directory created with 5 core documents
- [x] PHASE_1_CHECKLIST.md with exact implementation steps
- [x] Architecture decisions documented in ADRs
- [x] Implementation progress tracking ready
- [x] Session protocols established for AI continuity

## Critical Decisions Made This Session
- **Architecture Approach**: Complete separation (legacy preservation + parallel system)
- **File Structure**: legacy_evidence_system/ + parallel_evidence_system/ directories
- **Repository Strategy**: Same repo, modular directory structure
- **Migration Strategy**: Feature flag controlled with A/B testing
- **AI Partnership**: Context transfer documentation for session continuity

## Performance Target
- **Current**: 396s total (49.4s × 8 evidence cycles)
- **Target**: <30s total processing time
- **Expected Improvement**: 87% reduction through parallel claim + AI processing

## EEG + ACI Integration Requirements
- **EEG Phase 1**: Methodology-first IFCN-compliant queries (9 vs 144 operations)
- **ACI Pipeline**: Semantic analysis → Logical analysis → Domain classification
- **Integration Point**: Enhanced strategy generation at orchestrator level
