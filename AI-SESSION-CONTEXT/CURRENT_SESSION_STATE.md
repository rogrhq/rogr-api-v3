# Session State: 2025-01-12 - Architecture Analysis & Planning Complete

## What Was Accomplished This Session
- [x] **CRITICAL DISCOVERY**: Current sequential architecture fundamentally incompatible with parallel processing
- [x] **ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED**: Thread-safety violations prevent <30s performance target
- [x] **INVESTIGATION COMPLETE**: Comprehensive analysis of web search, content extraction, AI API bottlenecks
- [x] **ARCHITECTURE DESIGNED**: Complete parallel modular architecture with EEG + ACI integration
- [x] **FILE STRUCTURE PLANNED**: Legacy preservation + parallel system approach
- [x] **AI-PARTNERSHIP FRAMEWORK**: Context transfer system designed for Claude Code limitations

## Current Code State
**Branch:** main (preparation for architecture migration)
**Last Commit:** d9f12c6 - "Restore sophisticated evidence scoring to ROGR Evidence Shepherd"
**Files to Migrate:** 13 shepherd files in root directory need legacy preservation
**Performance Issue:** 49.4s per claim processing vs <30s total target (13x too slow)

## Architecture Analysis Results
### Sequential Processing Bottlenecks Identified:
1. **Dual AI Sequential Execution**: Primary → Wait → Secondary → Wait = 2x processing time
2. **Shared Resource Conflicts**: Non-thread-safe sessions, API keys, consensus analysis
3. **Evidence Scoring Chain**: 30s timeout × 2 AIs × 4 claims = 240s+ sequential processing
4. **Web Search Timeout Stacking**: Multiple API timeouts compounding delays

### Parallel Architecture Solution Designed:
- **ParallelEvidenceOrchestrator**: Centralized strategy generation (EEG + ACI)
- **ThreadSafeEvidenceWorker**: Stateless parallel execution workers
- **ThreadSafeResourcePool**: Isolated HTTP sessions, AI clients, rate limiting
- **ParallelConsensusEngine**: Claim-level + AI-level parallelization

## Next AI Session Should Start With
1. **IMMEDIATE (5 min)**: Read this document + NEXT_SESSION_OBJECTIVES.md
2. **PHASE 1 START (15 min)**: Create legacy_evidence_system/ directory and migrate files
3. **FOUNDATION (30 min)**: Implement ThreadSafeResourcePool base architecture
4. **VALIDATION (10 min)**: Test resource pool thread isolation

## Critical Decisions Made This Session
- **Architecture Approach**: Complete separation (legacy preservation + parallel system)
- **File Structure**: legacy_evidence_system/ + parallel_evidence_system/ directories
- **Repository Strategy**: Same repo, modular directory structure
- **Migration Strategy**: Feature flag controlled with A/B testing
- **AI Partnership**: Context transfer documentation for session continuity

## Performance Target
- **Current**: 396s total (49.4s × 8 evidence cycles)
- **Target**: <30s total processing time
- **Expected Improvement**: 87% reduction through parallel claim + AI processing

## EEG + ACI Integration Requirements
- **EEG Phase 1**: Methodology-first IFCN-compliant queries (9 vs 144 operations)
- **ACI Pipeline**: Semantic analysis → Logical analysis → Domain classification
- **Integration Point**: Enhanced strategy generation at orchestrator level
