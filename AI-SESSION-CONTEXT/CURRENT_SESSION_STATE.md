# Session State: 2025-09-14 - BREAKTHROUGH: Root Cause Found, Solution Path Clear

## What Was Accomplished This Session
- [x] **USER-AGENT FIX**: Updated Chrome version from 91 (2021) to 120 (2024) in both systems
- [x] **THREAD-LOCAL SESSIONS**: Implemented per architecture spec - replaced shared session with thread-local
- [x] **BOT DETECTION CONFIRMED**: 403 errors occur locally with curl - external Cloudflare protection
- [x] **CRITICAL DISCOVERY**: Legacy system works (86/A-), parallel fails (0/F) on SAME URLs
- [x] **ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED**: Parallel system "all-or-nothing" vs legacy "best-effort" design flaw
- [x] **EVIDENCE FOUND**: Legacy 8/10 successful extractions â†’ continues, Parallel 403 errors â†’ fails completely

## Current Code State
**Branch:** main (Integration path added, but system still non-functional)
**Last Commit:** f522bdc - "Fix parallel worker URL processing failure for basic facts"
**Backend Status:** ðŸ”„ Currently on Legacy System for Testing - https://69780239-96f5-4ce3-b826-d3453286c75d-00-2q5k9aqq28xtu.picard.replit.dev/
**Performance Status:** Legacy: 86/A- with partial failures | Parallel: 0/F complete failure | Simple fix needed

## Architecture Analysis Results
### Sequential Processing Bottlenecks Identified:
1. **Dual AI Sequential Execution**: Primary â†’ Wait â†’ Secondary â†’ Wait = 2x processing time
2. **Shared Resource Conflicts**: Non-thread-safe sessions, API keys, consensus analysis
3. **Evidence Scoring Chain**: 30s timeout Ã— 2 AIs Ã— 4 claims = 240s+ sequential processing
4. **Web Search Timeout Stacking**: Multiple API timeouts compounding delays

### Parallel Architecture Solution Designed:
- **ParallelEvidenceOrchestrator**: Centralized strategy generation (EEG + ACI)
- **ThreadSafeEvidenceWorker**: Stateless parallel execution workers
- **ThreadSafeResourcePool**: Isolated HTTP sessions, AI clients, rate limiting
- **ParallelConsensusEngine**: Claim-level + AI-level parallelization

## Next AI Session Should Start With
1. **IMMEDIATE (5 min)**: Read this document + NEXT_SESSION_OBJECTIVES.md + SESSION_START_PROTOCOL.md
2. **ERROR HANDLING FIX (45 min)**: Implement "Best-Effort" Content Extraction in Parallel System:
   - Modify parallel system to continue processing despite 403 errors (like legacy does)
   - Change "all-or-nothing" approach to "8/10 successful" graceful degradation
   - Test that parallel system produces 80+ scores for basic facts after fix
   - Switch back to USE_PARALLEL_EVIDENCE=true after implementation
3. **RDT COMPLIANCE (5 min)**: Update context documentation with investigation results

## CRITICAL: Complete Context Transfer System Ready
- [x] AI-SESSION-CONTEXT/ directory created with 5 core documents
- [x] PHASE_1_CHECKLIST.md with exact implementation steps
- [x] Architecture decisions documented in ADRs
- [x] Implementation progress tracking ready
- [x] Session protocols established for AI continuity

## Critical Decisions Made This Session
- **Architecture Approach**: Complete separation (legacy preservation + parallel system)
- **File Structure**: legacy_evidence_system/ + parallel_evidence_system/ directories
- **Repository Strategy**: Same repo, modular directory structure
- **Migration Strategy**: Feature flag controlled with A/B testing
- **AI Partnership**: Context transfer documentation for session continuity

## Performance Target
- **Current**: 396s total (49.4s Ã— 8 evidence cycles)
- **Target**: <30s total processing time
- **Expected Improvement**: 87% reduction through parallel claim + AI processing

## EEG + ACI Integration Requirements
- **EEG Phase 1**: Methodology-first IFCN-compliant queries (9 vs 144 operations)
- **ACI Pipeline**: Semantic analysis â†’ Logical analysis â†’ Domain classification
- **Integration Point**: Enhanced strategy generation at orchestrator level
