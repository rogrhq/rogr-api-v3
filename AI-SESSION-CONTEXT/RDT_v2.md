# ROGR Development Tenants v2.0
**Enhanced AI Partnership Development Methodology**

*Incorporating Session 14 Breakthrough Insights: Context Transfer Architecture, Integration Completeness, and AI Partnership Methodology*

---

## **Core Development Tenants**

### **1. DESIGN COHESION**
All solutions, plans and proposed solutions must align with the modular and scalable design architecture we have developed. Solutions must preserve architectural integrity while enabling parallel processing, thread safety, and system scalability.

### **2. COMPLETE SOLUTIONS** 
All solutions, plans and proposed solutions will be complete and thorough fixes, not work arounds or band-aids unless otherwise requested. Solutions must address root causes and provide production-ready implementations with proper error handling, monitoring, and rollback capabilities.

### **3. ALWAYS COMPLIANT**
All solutions, plans and proposed solutions remain aligned with IFCN compliance and ROGR Development Tenants. Evidence processing must maintain methodology-first approach, transparency standards, and professional fact-checking protocols.

### **4. NO ASSUMPTIONS & ARCHITECTURAL COMPLETENESS**
All solutions and plans will be proposed and any implimentations will be started ONLY AFTER:
- a) All related design and code has been examined and reviewed. This includes even when any exisitng context documents assign fact. You MUST still ALWAYS examine actual code first. Before ANY solution or plan proposal, you must first output: 1. Files examined: [list actual files and line numbers] 2. Commands run: [list actual commands executed] 3. Integration points identified: [list specific touch points] Only AFTER providing this investigation summary may you propose solutions.
- b) Thorough understanding of the problem has been ascertained
- c) Thread safety, resource sharing, and integration impacts investigated
- d) Complete integration ecosystem compatibility verified (ClaimMiner, FastAPI endpoints, frontend)
- e) Solutions have been vetted through all RDT tenants

**Enhanced Standard:** Architectural solutions and plans require comprehensive investigation of shared resources, concurrency implications, and system integration before any implementation proposals.

### **5. CLARITY ALWAYS**
If any of these tenants are unclear at any time, a request for clarity MUST be made and NO solutions may be proposed or implemented until clarity has been provided. Context ambiguity must be resolved before proceeding with development work.

### **6. ASK PERMISSION**
Permission is always required to make ANY CHANGES to any document within the local or remote repositories. Permission is not required to answer questions or present plans or results of an examination or investigation. Context document updates require explicit permission before session end.

### **7. NO DEVIATIONS - Enhanced Integrity Check**
All tenants will always be followed, unless specifically instructed otherwise. You MUST SELF CERTIFY EVERY response you give and include the certification compliance at begining of your answer with the following:
- **"✅ RDT"** ONLY if ALL tenants are genuinely complied with (no false
  certification)
  - **"❌ RDT"** ALWAYS if ANY tenant has been violated, with specific 
  violations identified
- Context preservation status must be confirmed before session end
- Integration completeness must be verified for all architectural solutions

**Critical Standard:** False RDT certification undermines AI-human partnership integrity and is strictly prohibited.

## **AI Partnership Development Tenants**

### **8. CONTEXT CONTINUITY**
All development sessions must preserve complete context for seamless AI partnership continuation. Context transfer documentation must be updated before session end, and all session handoffs must include comprehensive state preservation to prevent knowledge loss across AI session boundaries.

**Requirements:**
- Update AI-SESSION-CONTEXT documents before session end
- Preserve implementation progress with specific completion status
- Document architectural decisions and their rationale
- Establish clear objectives for next AI session
- Maintain git repository in clean state with descriptive commits

### **9. INTEGRATION COMPLETENESS**
All architectural solutions must be verified for complete integration with existing systems (ClaimMiner, FastAPI endpoints, frontend compatibility). Implementation plans are not complete until full integration ecosystem has been examined and connectivity verified.

**Requirements:**
- Verify compatibility with ClaimMiner workflow
- Ensure FastAPI endpoint integration capability  
- Confirm frontend response format compatibility
- Validate production deployment requirements
- Test complete end-to-end pipeline functionality

### **10. AI PARTNERSHIP METHODOLOGY**
All development sessions must follow established AI collaboration patterns including: context loading protocols, session time management, progress verification, and systematic handoff procedures. AI partnership limitations must be designed around, not worked within.

**Requirements:**
- Follow SESSION_START_PROTOCOL for context loading
- Use established CODE_PATTERNS for implementation consistency
- Apply session time management (75-90 minute optimal sessions)
- Implement progress verification at regular intervals
- Design systematic solutions for AI context limitations

## **Implementation Standards**

### **Thread Safety Requirements (RDT #1, #4)**
- All parallel components must use ThreadSafeComponent base pattern
- Resource isolation through thread-local storage mandatory
- No shared state between concurrent operations
- Context manager pattern for all resource cleanup

### **Performance Standards (RDT #2, #9)**
- <30s total processing time target for complete pipeline
- Memory leak prevention through proper resource management
- Scalable architecture supporting N-way consensus expansion
- Production monitoring and health check integration

### **Quality Assurance Standards (RDT #3, #7)**
- IFCN compliance maintained through methodology-first approach
- Evidence quality scoring with transparent criteria
- Professional fact-checking protocols preserved
- Comprehensive testing at component and integration levels

### **Documentation Standards (RDT #5, #8)**
- All architectural decisions recorded with rationale
- Implementation patterns documented for consistency
- Context transfer documentation maintained
- Code comments focused on WHY decisions were made

## **Session Management Protocol**

### **Session Start Requirements (RDT #8, #10)**
1. **Context Loading:** Read CURRENT_SESSION_STATE.md, NEXT_SESSION_OBJECTIVES.md, SESSION_START_PROTOCOL.md
2. **Understanding Confirmation:** Verify current phase, objectives, performance targets, blocking issues
3. **Time Planning:** Establish session duration and priority objectives
4. **Pattern Compliance:** Confirm adherence to established CODE_PATTERNS.md

### **Session Progress Requirements (RDT #10)**
- Progress verification every 20-30 minutes
- Implementation testing before component transitions
- Git commits with descriptive messages for all changes
- Pattern compliance validation for new implementations

### **Session End Requirements (RDT #6, #8)**
1. **Context Preservation:** Update CURRENT_SESSION_STATE.md with accomplishments
2. **Next Session Preparation:** Set clear NEXT_SESSION_OBJECTIVES.md priorities  
3. **Progress Documentation:** Update IMPLEMENTATION_PROGRESS.md completion status
4. **Pattern Documentation:** Add new patterns to CODE_PATTERNS.md if established
5. **Repository Cleanup:** Ensure clean git state with committed changes
