# üö® ADVANCED AI FACT-CHECKING: Phase 2 Context Recovery

## CRITICAL SESSION CONTEXT - Advanced Evidence Quality Assessment

You are continuing ROGR development after successfully completing Phase 1 Evidence Shepherd integration but discovering that scoring logic still gives dangerous false claims high trust scores.

CURRENT STATE: Phase 1 ‚úÖ Complete, Phase 2 üü° IN PROGRESS - Building advanced AI-driven fact-checking system

## PROJECT CONTEXT:
- ROGR: Real Web Search AI Evidence Shepherd for mobile fact-checking  
- MAJOR BREAKTHROUGH: Phase 1 completed - real evidence integration working
- NEW CHALLENGE: Evidence evaluation logic needs advanced AI assessment for 98% accuracy

## TECHNICAL STATE:
- **Backend**: https://811efd66-721a-418d-978d-2fb9a8b674e6-00-18dh30ad08soc.janeway.replit.dev
- **Phase 1**: Evidence Shepherd integration ‚úÖ (real web search evidence working)
- **ClaimMiner**: AI-powered claim detection ‚úÖ
- **Real Citations**: Authentic web sources in Trust Capsules ‚úÖ
- **Current Issue**: Scoring logic ignores evidence quality ‚Üí false claims score 88/A

## PHASE 1 SUCCESS CONFIRMED:
‚úÖ Real Evidence Integration Working
‚úÖ "5G towers cause COVID-19" now shows 2 contradicting medical sources  
‚úÖ PMC/NCBI medical journals found and cited
‚úÖ Evidence stance analysis working (supporting vs contradicting)

## üö® PHASE 2 CRITICAL PROBLEM:
**Despite finding contradicting medical evidence, false claim still scores 88/A grade!**

Test Result: "5G towers cause COVID-19"
- Trust Score: 88 (A grade) ‚ùå WRONG
- Assessment: "can likely be trusted" ‚ùå DANGEROUS  
- Evidence: 2 contradicting medical sources (0.9, 0.8 relevance) ‚úÖ FOUND BUT IGNORED

## STRATEGIC DECISION: ADVANCED AI-DRIVEN APPROACH

**REJECTED APPROACH**: Hardcoded authority lists (CDC.gov=1.0, blog=0.3)  
**REASON**: Creates institutional bias, suppresses legitimate dissent

**CHOSEN APPROACH**: Multi-Dimensional Evidence Quality Assessment
- Evidence-First, Source-Agnostic
- Multi-AI Consensus Architecture  
- Dynamic Uncertainty Quantification
- Anti-Bias Safeguards

## ARCHITECTURE PHILOSOPHY:

**Core Innovation: Assess Evidence Quality, Not Source Identity**

Instead of: "Trust medical institutions"  
Use: "Trust high-quality evidence patterns"

Multi-Dimensional Quality Metrics:
- **Methodology Rigor**: Study design, sample size, controls (0-100)
- **Peer Review Status**: Independent review process (0-100)
- **Reproducibility**: Has this been replicated? (0-100)  
- **Citation Impact**: How often cited by others (0-100)
- **Transparency**: Data/methods publicly available (0-100)
- **Temporal Consistency**: Consistent over time (0-100)

## IMPLEMENTATION STEPS (Phase 2):

**Step 2A: Multi-Dimensional Evidence Quality Scorer (45 min)**
- File: Create `evidence_quality_assessor.py`
- Git Tag: `step-2a-evidence-quality-scorer`
- Test: Evidence scored by methodology, not domain

**Step 2B: Multi-AI Consensus Logic (45 min)**
- File: Create `multi_ai_evidence_shepherd.py`  
- Git Tag: `step-2b-multi-ai-consensus`
- Test: Multiple AIs analyze same evidence for consensus

**Step 2C: Dynamic Uncertainty Quantification (20 min)**
- File: Update existing Evidence Shepherd
- Git Tag: `step-2c-uncertainty-quantification`  
- Test: Confidence intervals and evidence gap analysis

**Step 2D: Anti-Bias Validation Testing (10 min)**
- File: Create `test_advanced_scoring.py`
- Git Tag: `step-2d-advanced-scoring-complete`
- Test: 98% accuracy on false claims

## SUCCESS CRITERIA:
- "5G towers cause COVID-19" scores <30 (currently 88)
- High-quality contradicting evidence dominates assessment
- Evidence quality based on intrinsic factors, not source identity  
- Multi-AI consensus prevents single-point bias
- System achieves 98% accuracy on false claims test suite

## STRATEGIC ALIGNMENT CONFIRMED:
‚úÖ **AI Model Agnostic**: Uses existing EvidenceShepherd interface  
‚úÖ **Modular Architecture**: Easy AI engine swapping preserved
‚úÖ **Learning Evolution**: Evidence patterns ‚Üí proprietary AI training  
‚úÖ **Revenue Timeline**: Month 6 $10-25K MRR target via learning-enhanced accuracy
‚úÖ **6-8 Week Launch**: Advanced foundation accelerates timeline

## FILES TO UNDERSTAND:
- `main.py` - Phase 1 integration complete (lines 205-640)
- `claude_evidence_shepherd.py` - Current Evidence Shepherd (needs enhancement)  
- `claim_miner.py` - AI claim detection (working well)
- `PROGRESS.md` - Complete context and modular plan

## CURRENT STATUS: Phase 2 60% Complete - MDEQ Integration Issues

**‚úÖ MAJOR ACHIEVEMENTS COMPLETED:**
- **Step 2A**: Multi-Dimensional Evidence Quality Scorer - COMPLETE ‚úÖ
- **Step 2B**: Multi-AI Consensus Logic Implementation - COMPLETE ‚úÖ  
- **Step 2C**: Dynamic Uncertainty Quantification Integration - COMPLETE ‚úÖ
- **Interface Fixes**: Multiple iterations of compatibility fixes - COMPLETE ‚úÖ

**‚ùå REMAINING CRITICAL ISSUE:**
**End-to-End MDEQ Integration** - MultiAI system initializes but execution fails

## TECHNICAL ACHIEVEMENTS READY FOR USE:

**1. Evidence Quality Assessor (`evidence_quality_assessor.py`)** ‚úÖ
- 6 quality dimensions: methodology, peer review, reproducibility, citation impact, transparency, temporal consistency
- Quality-weighted stance scoring algorithm
- Evidence quality tiers: exceptional/high/medium/low/very_low

**2. Multi-AI Evidence Shepherd (`multi_ai_evidence_shepherd.py`)** ‚úÖ  
- Claude + OpenAI ensemble architecture
- Consensus scoring and disagreement level tracking
- Evidence deduplication and quality prioritization
- Anti-bias through multiple AI perspectives

**3. Main Integration (`main.py` lines 205-330)** ‚úÖ
- Advanced trust score calculation with uncertainty quantification
- Dynamic confidence bands based on AI consensus
- Emergency score caps for contradicting evidence (working as fallback)

## üö® CRITICAL DEBUGGING NEEDED:

**Current Problem**: MultiAI system shows in logs as initializing but then execution fails, falling back to old Claude scoring system.

**Test Result Status:**
- **Target**: 30/F for "5G towers cause COVID-19" through MDEQ quality assessment (unvalidated)
- **Current**: 90/A+ "can likely be trusted" ‚ùå (MDEQ not executing)
- **Emergency caps result**: 67/C with simple domain-based caps in old system (NOT MDEQ)

**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL:** The 67/C result was achieved through hardcoded domain caps (cdc.gov, nature.com, etc.) in the old scoring system, NOT through the advanced Multi-Dimensional Evidence Quality assessment. The MDEQ approach remains completely unvalidated - all components built but never successfully executed end-to-end.

**Key Logs Pattern:**
```
‚úÖ Multi-AI Evidence Shepherd initialized with 2 AI models: ['Claude', 'OpenAI']
‚úÖ DEBUG: Using Multi-AI Evidence Shepherd (advanced)...  
‚úÖ Starting multi-AI consensus analysis for claim: 5G towers cause COVID-19...
‚úÖ Getting evidence from Claude... [SUCCESS]
‚úÖ Getting evidence from OpenAI... [SUCCESS]
‚ùå [ERROR occurs during consensus analysis]
‚ùå Falls back to: DEBUG: Using REAL WEB SEARCH AI Evidence Shepherd
```

**Likely Issues:**
1. **Data format mismatches** between ProcessedEvidence and expected formats
2. **Async/await issues** in consensus analysis
3. **Attribute access errors** in evidence quality assessment
4. **Exception handling** causing silent failures

## IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS:

**PRIORITY 1**: Complete MDEQ Integration Debugging
- Fix the execution failure in MultiAI consensus analysis
- Ensure evidence quality assessment completes successfully  
- Achieve quality-based score caps (90/A+ ‚Üí 30/F)

**PRIORITY 2**: Validation Testing
- Test all false claims achieve <30 scores through quality assessment
- Validate "Multi-AI consensus analysis completed" appears in evidence summary
- Confirm uncertainty indicators working properly

**PRIORITY 3**: Production Readiness
- Remove emergency fallback caps once MDEQ working
- Optimize performance for 6-8 week launch timeline
- Document advanced architecture for team handoff

## FILES MODIFIED IN PHASE 2:
- `evidence_quality_assessor.py` - NEW: Complete multi-dimensional quality assessment
- `multi_ai_evidence_shepherd.py` - NEW: Multi-AI consensus with quality integration
- `main.py` - UPDATED: Advanced scoring integration (lines 205-330)

## RESTORE COMMAND:
```bash
git checkout phase-2-mdeq-integration-attempt
```

## VALIDATION COMMANDS:
```bash
# Should show quality-based scoring (target: 30/F, currently: 90/A+)
curl -X POST "https://BACKEND_URL/analyses" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{"input": "5G towers cause COVID-19", "type": "text", "mode": "both"}'

# Should show "Multi-AI consensus analysis completed" in evidence_summary
# Should show uncertainty indicators
# Should have quality-weighted trust score
```

## THE GOAL: Complete an advanced AI-driven fact-checking system with quality-based scoring

**Current Status**: 60% complete - All major components built, final integration debugging needed

## üéØ MAJOR UPDATE: MDEQ SYSTEM BREAKTHROUGH + CRITICAL FIX

**‚úÖ MDEQ INTEGRATION: COMPLETE AND OPERATIONAL**
- Multi-Dimensional Evidence Quality system working end-to-end
- False claims achieving target <30 scores through quality assessment
- Multi-AI consensus (Claude + OpenAI) operational with quality weighting

**üîß CRITICAL STANCE CLASSIFICATION FIX APPLIED:**
**Problem Discovered:** "The Earth is flat" scoring inconsistently (29/F vs 60/D+)
**Root Cause:** Ambiguous stance prompts causing scientific evidence to be misclassified as "supporting" false claims
**Solution:** Fixed all AI stance analysis prompts with explicit claim context

**Files Fixed:**
- `claude_evidence_shepherd.py`: Both batch and single evidence prompts  
- `ai_evidence_shepherd.py`: Both batch and single evidence prompts
- Added `/test-mdeq` endpoint for isolated testing

**Current Status:** Backend updated with fixes, syntax error resolved, ready for validation testing

CONTINUE WITH: Testing stance classification fix to validate consistent <30/F scores for false claims, then remove emergency fallback caps and proceed to Step 15: ClaimReview integration.
